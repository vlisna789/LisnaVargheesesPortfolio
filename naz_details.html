					<h2>Nazaaqat Dance Team</h2>
          <p>During my sophomore year of college,  I was given the opportunity to co-captain an on-campus bollywood dance team - Nazaaqat. The work featured below couldn’t have been possible without the dedication of my team and co-captain. While directing this show I was able to expand my creative limits, encourage teamwork, bolster morale and implement creative solutions in order to optimize the best audience experience. </p>

							<h3>Theme</h3>
              <p>Before we start any show, we need a theme. The theme for this years performance was Pandora’s Box. Pandora’s Box is a greek story, it starts with a girl named Pandora who was trusted with carrying a box full of the the worlds emotions. Unfortunately Pandora was weak and opened the box, giving humans emotions.  We wanted to play on creating groups of dancers to represent the emotions coming out of the box. We gave each dancer an emotion and a part in the performance to highlight that emotion.
</p>
            </div>
						<h3>Formations</h3>
            <p>Formations had to be one of the biggest challenges of this performance. The colors within each performance had to be symmetrical and each dancer had to have time in the front. A typical dance performance changes formations every 12 seconds in order to keep attention of the audience. In order to make that happen the formations had to be seamless and not distracting. We also had to make sure the audience was looking at the right part of the stage so they didn’t miss any core story changes. This are not even ⅛ of the formations we created. </p>

             <h3>Costumes</h3>
             <p>Creating a show means creating an experience for a viewer. Each small choice we made creates a bigger impact for the audience. That’s why the costumes were a core part of our show as well. In order to further highlight the emotions, we made sure each costume was the color of the emotion it correlated to. We choose a base black for each member for the shall was different depending on your emotion.</p>

           <h3>Props</h3>
           <p>For props, we considered how do we further make this theme OBVIOUS? As a captain, I had to consider what parts of the show don’t have enough hints? Sure, music and costumes and dance style communicated some things, but the reality is, the audience doesn’t know what I know. Therefore we included some props!</p>
           <p>The two props we included in our show was a box for Pandora and a bow and arrow for the love sequence. We featured a box to make the beginning sequence in our story obvious. Below is the construction of our box and ribbons inside. </p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/Nazaaqat/BOXCONSTRUCTION.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
           <p>Inside each box contained a wooden O with ribbon on it. This was so that the dancer could take the ribbon out of the box. This action represented the “emotion” coming out out of the box after pandora opened it. Below you will see the box in action.</p>

           <p>Why a prop for ONLY the love sequence, what about sad, happy and angry??</p>
           <p>Well after bringing in our friends to preview our show, a lot of them said they couldn’t distinguish the difference between love and happy, so we decided to give “love” a prop! This is the cupid arrow in action.</p>

           <h3>Emotions</h3>
           <p>Emotions were also a key part of the dance performance. In order to further explain the story to the audience, we made sure our emotions on stage were representative of the story line. Our team practiced this by sending in emotion videos every week to our facebook page. This is a preview of what that looked like.</p>

           <h3>Choreography</h3>
           <p>The choreography in this show is the big takeaway. We couldn’t just highlight the beats in the song, we had to highlight the emotions the girls in the front were supposed to capture. While choreographing. I made sure each move fit with the theme and the song. If it was sadness, the moves were meant to be flowy, if it was angry the moves had to be harsh. If these elements weren’t perfect, we couldn’t continue with that choreography. Featured below are the snippets of the “sad” choreography. </p>
